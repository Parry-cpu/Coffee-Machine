# Coffee-Machine
This was bit challenging for me. Got to learn a lot. It may not follow the best practices for coding but I still learning. The code works on 3 functions, 

  1. Report function which keeps track of the resources like ingredients and money of the coffee machine
  2. The money function which calculates the money which is put into the machine, converts them into dollars. (I created a set for that which can be refered in the code). It also refunds the money if the ingredients     are not sufficient.
  3. The resource calculator which calculates how much ingredients are in the machine and how much money is in it.

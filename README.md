# Coffee-Machine
This was bit challenging for me. Got to learn a lot. It may not follow the best practices for coding but I still learning. The code works on 3 functions, 1. Report function which keeps track of the resources like ingredients and money of the coffee machine  2. The money function which calculates the money which is put into the machines.
